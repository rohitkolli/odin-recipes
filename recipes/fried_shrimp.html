    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, but big on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo" size shrimp,
        which are 16-20 per pound. Cutting the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it easier to wrap.
        Refrigerating the shrimp, as well as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp from overcooking in the time
        it takes to crisp the bacon.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 jumbo Shrimp, fresh, raw, jumbo (11-15)</li>

        <li>¾ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>

        <li>8 strips thin sliced bacon, cut in half</li>

        <li>16 toothpicks</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons hot honey (such as Mike's Hot Honey®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place shrimp on a plate and sprinkle both sides with Cajun seasoning. Wrap each shrimp with 1 narrow strip
            of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Air-fry shrimp for 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until bacon is lightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes more.
            You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp to a plate and drizzle with hot honey. Serve immediately, being watchful of any toothpicks.
        </li>

    </ol>
